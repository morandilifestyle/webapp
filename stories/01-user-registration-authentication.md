# User Story: User Registration and Authentication

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-001
- **Epic**: User Management System
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8

## User Story
**As a** new customer  
**I want** to register for an account and securely log in  
**So that** I can access personalized features, track my orders, and manage my profile

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Registration Process**
   - User can register with email, password, first name, and last name
   - Email validation is performed with proper format checking
   - Password must meet security requirements (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number)
   - Email verification is sent upon successful registration
   - User cannot proceed without email verification

2. **Login Process**
   - User can log in with email and password
   - Remember me functionality is available
   - Forgot password functionality sends reset email
   - Failed login attempts are limited to prevent brute force attacks
   - Session timeout after 24 hours of inactivity

3. **Profile Management**
   - User can view and edit their profile information
   - User can add multiple shipping and billing addresses
   - User can set default addresses for shipping and billing
   - User can update communication preferences
   - Profile changes are saved and reflected immediately

4. **Security Features**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - JWT tokens are used for session management
   - CSRF protection is implemented
   - Input validation prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks
   - Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

5. **Social Login Integration**
   - Google OAuth integration for quick registration/login
   - Facebook OAuth integration (optional)
   - Social login data is properly mapped to user profile

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Frontend Implementation
- **Registration Form**: React form with validation using react-hook-form
- **Login Form**: Simple login with remember me checkbox
- **Profile Page**: Editable form with address management
- **State Management**: Auth context for user state across app
- **Routing**: Protected routes for authenticated users

### Backend Implementation
- **User Service**: Handle user CRUD operations
- **Auth Service**: JWT token generation and validation
- **Email Service**: SendGrid integration for verification emails
- **Password Service**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Validation**: Joi or Yup for input validation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table (already defined in architecture)
-- User addresses table for multiple addresses
CREATE TABLE user_addresses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    address_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'billing', 'shipping'
    address_line1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_line2 VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    postal_code VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'India',
    is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register          # User registration
POST /api/auth/login             # User login
POST /api/auth/logout            # User logout
POST /api/auth/refresh           # Refresh token
POST /api/auth/forgot-password   # Forgot password
POST /api/auth/reset-password    # Reset password
GET  /api/auth/profile           # Get user profile
PUT  /api/auth/profile           # Update user profile
GET  /api/auth/addresses         # Get user addresses
POST /api/auth/addresses         # Add new address
PUT  /api/auth/addresses/:id     # Update address
DELETE /api/auth/addresses/:id   # Delete address
```

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database with users and user_addresses tables
- **Email Service**: SendGrid account for transactional emails
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with authentication context
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with JWT middleware
- **Environment Variables**: JWT secret, SendGrid API key, OAuth credentials

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] Email verification is sent and required for account activation
- [ ] User can log in with email and password
- [ ] Forgot password functionality works correctly
- [ ] User can view and edit their profile
- [ ] User can manage multiple addresses
- [ ] Social login integration works (Google)
- [ ] Security features are implemented (password hashing, JWT, CSRF)
- [ ] Input validation prevents common attacks
- [ ] Session management works correctly
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] Unit tests cover all authentication functions
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end registration/login flow
- [ ] Performance testing shows login/registration under 2 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is verified
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Story Points Estimation
**8 Story Points** - This is a complex story involving multiple security considerations, email integration, and comprehensive user management features.

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Email delivery issues could prevent account activation
- **Low Risk**: Social login integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback email service and thorough testing of OAuth flows

## Notes
- Consider implementing phone number verification as an alternative to email
- Plan for GDPR compliance with user data management
- Ensure proper error handling for all authentication scenarios
