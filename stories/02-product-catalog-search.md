### Database Schema
```sql
-- Product categories with hierarchy
CREATE TABLE product_categories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    parent_id UUID REFERENCES product_categories(id),
    image_url VARCHAR(500),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Products with search optimization
CREATE TABLE products (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    category_id UUID REFERENCES product_categories(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    short_description VARCHAR(500),
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    sale_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    cost_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    sku VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    barcode VARCHAR(100),
    weight DECIMAL(8,2),
    dimensions JSONB, -- {length, width, height}
    attributes JSONB, -- {material, color, size, organic_certified}
    images JSONB, -- Array of image URLs
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    stock_quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    low_stock_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
    meta_title VARCHAR(255),
    meta_description TEXT,
    search_vector tsvector, -- For full-text search
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_products_search ON products USING gin(search_vector);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_id ON products(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products(price);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_is_active ON products(is_active);
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/products                    # List products with filters
GET /api/products/:slug              # Get product details
GET /api/categories                  # List categories
GET /api/categories/:slug            # Get category with products
GET /api/search                      # Search products
GET /api/products/featured           # Get featured products
GET /api/products/related/:id        # Get related products
```

### Search Implementation
```sql
-- Update search vector on product changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_product_search_vector()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.search_vector :=
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.name, '')), 'A') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.description, '')), 'B') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.short_description, '')), 'C');
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER products_search_vector_update
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON products
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_product_search_vector();
```
